I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Oncology at the University of Cambridge, affiliated with the [Crispin Lab](https://www.crispinlab.com/) at the CRUK Cambridge Centre and the Early Cancer Institute. My current research is funded by GE Healthcare. I am also a Postdoctoral Fellow of Trinity College, University of Cambridge.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2023, where I was jointly trained by the School of Computer Science and the School of Mathematics and Statistics, under the supervision of Prof. Chen Li and Prof. Deyu Meng.
Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree from the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, under the supervision of Prof. Xiangrong Zhang.

Research
------
My current research focuses on computational pathology, specifically on the development and application of machine learning and deep learning models to extract clinically relevant information from histopathological images, thereby improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and treatment prediction.

My work involves the analysis of pathological images across multiple scales and leverages a range of learning paradigms—including semi-supervised learning, multi-instance learning, contrastive learning, vision-language models, and diffusion models to tackle various challenges in computational pathology.
